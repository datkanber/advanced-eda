# Advanced Functional Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository focuses on **Advanced Functionalized Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, providing a step-by-step guide to uncover patterns, identify relationships, and prepare datasets for further analysis.

## 📖 What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in data science that helps to:
- Summarize the main characteristics of datasets.
- Visualize relationships between variables.
- Detect anomalies and patterns.
- Check assumptions and validate statistical techniques.

### 🔍 Key Analysis Areas:
1. **Categorical Variables**: Distribution and frequency analysis.
2. **Numerical Variables**: Summary statistics and visualizations (histograms, boxplots).
3. **Target Variable**: Correlation and relationships with other variables.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying highly correlated features.
